# Snake
I made this primarily to experiment with different ways to output graphics

a python/processing approach can be found in the game folder. (game.pyde has everything you need)

the playonline folder contains the js approach, which is objectively cleaner and better code.
However, there is a bug that occurs when two arrow keys are pressed simultaneously - I will fix this soon
