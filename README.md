# Snake
I made this primarily to experiment with different ways to output graphics

src contains the js approach, which is objectively cleaner and better code.
However, there is a bug that occurs when two arrow keys are pressed simultaneously - I will fix this soon

a python/processing approach can be found in the pySnake folder. (game.pyde has everything you need)
